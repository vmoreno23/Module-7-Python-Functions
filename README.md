# Module-7-Python-Functions

Hello my name is Victor, I am the author of these programs. There are six Python code programs within this repository. To use each of the programs paste the program's code into a text editor with Python support, run the program, and follow any on screen instructions and the results will be provided.

Problem 1 asks to write a function named 'areaOfCircle(r)' that returns the area of a circle of radius r.

Problem 2 asks for a function to check whether a number is in a given range using 'range(1,10)' and printing whether the number is in range or not.

Problem 3 asks for a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list using [5, 2, 7, -1].

Problem 4 asks for a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list. Using list [1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 2, 3, 5] and the 'append' function. 

Problem 5 asks to produce an image of 5 squares within each other getting larger for every square out. Starter code provided by Professor Braun.

Problem 6 asks to modify code to include two additional attributes of 'type' and 'manufacturer'. Then adding the corresponding methods to print those attributes. Lastly, modify the mehtod fullspecs() to return the additional attributes. Starter code provided by Professor Braun.
